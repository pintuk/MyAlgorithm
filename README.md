# MyAlgorithm

This repository may contains some of the algorithm and data structure questions that I have developed.
It may also contains some of the algorithm puzzle solved by me.

These files are not related to each other. However, some of the algorithm function may be used in some of the puzzles.
Thus these files needs to be compiled individually.
To compile, simpley use:
> gcc filename.c
To execute, simply do:
> ./a.out
